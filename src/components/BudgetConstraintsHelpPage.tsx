              Before you adjust budgets, make sure you understand how the four
              budget controls work and how this dashboard evaluates them. This
              page focuses on what the red banner checks before it warns about
              blocking risk.

          <Section title="Effective ULB">
            <p>GitHub evaluates an effective ULB for each user:</p>
            <Formula>
              effective ULB = max(individual ULB, universal ULB)
            </Formula>
            <p>
              <Term>Regular users</Term> are users without an individual ULB.
              Their effective ULB is the universal ULB.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Shared AI Credit Pool and metered charges">
            <p>
              Included credits are one enterprise-wide <Term>shared pool</Term>.
              There is no per-user included allowance. There is no per-user plan
              default.
            </p>
            <Formula>
              pool value = (Copilot Business seats × $19) + (Copilot Enterprise
              seats × $39)
            </Formula>
            <p>
              If user-level budgets collectively allow more consumption than the
              pool value provides, the difference becomes{' '}
              <Term>metered charges</Term>. Cost center budgets and enterprise
              budget need to be high enough to cover that gap.
            </p>
            <p>Here&apos;s how to estimate:</p>
            <Formula>
              max user consumption = (regular users × universal ULB) + Σ
              individual ULBs{'\n'}
              gap = max user consumption − pool value{'\n'}
              required spend coverage = Σ cost center budgets + enterprise
              budget ≥ gap
            </Formula>
            <p className="text-xs opacity-75">
              <strong>Tip:</strong> Whenever you raise the universal ULB or any
              individual user-level budget, re-check this calculation. Raising
              ULBs without raising shared budgets can block users before they
              reach their individual limits.

          <Section title="Cost center exclusion">
            <p>
              The enterprise budget has a <Term>cost center exclusion</Term>{' '}
              setting that changes scope.
            </p>
            <p>Here&apos;s how it works:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>
                <Term>Cost center exclusion off</Term> (default). Cost center
                spend also draws from enterprise budget capacity. If the sum of
                cost center budgets is above the enterprise budget, the
                enterprise budget can block cost center users early.
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>Cost center exclusion on</Term>. Cost centers are capped
                by their own budgets, and enterprise budget covers only users
                outside budgeted cost centers.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Cost centers and Copilot billing">
            <p>
              A cost center groups users and/or organizations so their
              Copilot spend can be tracked and capped separately from the
              enterprise pool. Each cost center has its own ai_credits
              budget; users routed through a CC draw from the CC's budget
              before falling back to the enterprise budget (subject to{' '}
              <Term>cost center exclusion</Term> above).
            </p>
            <p>How CCs interact with each GitHub Copilot product:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>
                <Term>Copilot Business / Enterprise seat licenses</Term> are
                billed per seat regardless of CC assignment. The CC budget
                does <em>not</em> cap license cost; it caps metered AI Credit
                consumption (premium requests, coding-agent units, etc.).
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>AI Credit metered spend</Term> (premium requests,
                coding agent, model overages) is what CC budgets actually
                gate. When a CC user's effective ULB is exhausted or the CC
                budget hits its cap, further metered usage is blocked or
                alerted per budget config.
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>Users not assigned to a CC</Term> draw from the
                enterprise budget directly. If the enterprise budget is
                missing or undersized, those users can be blocked even when
                CC users still have headroom.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-xs opacity-75">
              The Dashboard's "Cost centers" card and the "Budget filter"
              dropdowns elsewhere in the app show CCs that have at least
              one Copilot seat. CCs with zero Copilot seats are filtered
              out automatically since they don't draw from the pool.

          <Section title="Max safe universal ULB">
            <p>
              The dashboard computes the highest universal ULB that keeps all
              three checks passing, with budgets and individual user-level
              budgets held fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Situation: You want to raise universal ULB but keep the current
              budgets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Configuration: Raise universal ULB only up to the max safe
              universal ULB value. If even universal ULB = $0 fails, individual
              user-level budgets already exceed your current envelopes. Raise
              budgets, lower specific individual ULBs, or reroute users between
              cost centers.
            </p>

          <Section title="Worked example">
            <p>
              Cost center <Term>&quot;eng&quot;</Term> has a $500 budget and 3
              members. Two have individual ULBs of $100. The third has none.
              With universal ULB = $50:
            </p>
            <Formula>
              effective ULBs = max(100, 50) + max(100, 50) + max(0, 50) = 100 +
              100 + 50 = $250
            </Formula>
            <p>
              $250 ≤ $500, so the per-cost-center check passes. Raise universal
              ULB to $200:
            </p>
            <Formula>
              effective ULBs = max(100, 200) + max(100, 200) + max(0, 200) =

            </Formula>
            <p>
              $600 &gt; $500, so the check fails. The max safe universal ULB is
              $150 ($150 + $150 + $150 = $450 ≤ $500).

              Setting per-user ULBs in bulk hits one PATCH per user. With a
              classic PAT the primary ceiling is{' '}
              <Term>5,000 requests per hour</Term> for the entire token, and a
              secondary "abuse" limit fires inside that window when traffic
              bursts. At 4,500 users a single bulk apply consumes nearly the
              full hourly quota, leaving little room for the dashboard's own
