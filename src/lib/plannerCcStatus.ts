/**
 * Planner-specific cost-center status classification.
 *
 * Distinct from src/lib/ccStatus.ts (which classifies live budget health
 * for the read-only dashboard). Here we classify each CC row by the action
 * the operator needs to take in the Planner:
 *
 *   - uncapped: CC affects Copilot but has no per-CC budget. Highest
 *               priority — usage is only bounded by the enterprise pool.
 *   - under-min: CC has a budget, but it is less than the computed floor
 *                (sum of effective ULBs for its Copilot seats). Will block
 *                users before they reach their ULB ceilings.
 *   - ok: budget covers the floor, or no minimum is required.
